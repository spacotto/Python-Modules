## Module 00: Growing Code, Python Fundamentals Through Garden Data
The main topic of this module is an introduction to **Python's fundamental syntax and semantics**. It focuses on building core programming blocks such as variables, expressions, functions, control flow, and iteration (both loops and recursion). By solving hypothetical and simplified real-world scenarios, like calculating garden plot areas or tracking harvest yields, you develop computational thinking and problem-solving skills while contributing to sustainable community initiatives.
